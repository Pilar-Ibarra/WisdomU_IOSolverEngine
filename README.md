# WisdomU: IO-Solver Engine 

**WisdomU** is a solving engine for **Operations Research** problems, developed in Python. This project translates complex mathematical models (based on the methodology of *Hillier & Lieberman*) into functional and scalable algorithms.

##  Technical Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Implementation of abstract classes and inheritance to decouple mathematical models from solving algorithms (Solvers).
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** Extensive use of SOLID principles to ensure the code is maintainable and extensible.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle multiple decision variables and constraints dynamically.

## Project Structure

- `models/`: Contains the logic of mathematical models and the abstract base class.
- `solvers/`: Implementation of solving algorithms (e.g., Simplex, heuristic methods).
- `utils/`: Auxiliary tools for data processing and validation.
- `notes/`:Descriptions of the operation the programmed modules and theory on which they are based.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.14.3
- **Environment:** VS Code + Git
- **Core Theory:** *Introduction to Operations Research* (Hillier & Lieberman, 9th Ed).

## 📈 Roadmap (In Development)
- [ ] Integration with optimization libraries for cases with more than 5 variables.
- [ ] Enhanced command-line interface (CLI).
- [ ] Detailed technical documentation for each algorithm.
